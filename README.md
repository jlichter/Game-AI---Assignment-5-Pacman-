# Game-AI---Assignment-5-Pacman-
implementation for the decision making algorithms for the ghosts in Pacman.

Team Members: Alberto Mejia & Jessia Lichter

Implementations:

	-Fixed an audio glitch in framework where after grabbing a power pellet, the music would play forever.
    -Added the ability to move on to a next level. Previously, the player did not get a new screenful of dots once all of them had been consumed
    -The score now carries over between "levels" AKA each time a screenful of dots is created
    -Scoring is displayed and updated correctly on screen
